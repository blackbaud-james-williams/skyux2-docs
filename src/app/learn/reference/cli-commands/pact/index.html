  <p>
    <stache-code>skyux pact</stache-code> runs pact tests. Pact is a testing framework that you can use to test a SPA's integration with the services that it consumes. Karma is configured to run any files in the <stache-code>src/app</stache-code> folder with names that end in <stache-code>.pact-spec.ts</stache-code>. The <stache-code>pact</stache-code> command reads the <stache-code>pacts</stache-code> setting in the <stache-code>skyuxconfig.json</stache-code> configuration file and spins up an individual pact server for each provider service specified in the <stache-code>pacts</stache-code> property. It also spins up a pact server for the proxy server. We recommend creating pact tests for all services that the SPA consumes to confirm that your SPA can call out to the provider services and vice versa. For information about how to configure the SPA for pact testing, see <a routerLink="/learn/reference/configuration">the configuration reference</a>. And for more information on configuration settings and guidance on how to write pact tests, see <a routerLink="/learn/get-started/advanced/pact-tests">the pact testing tutorial</a>.
